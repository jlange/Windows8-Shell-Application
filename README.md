Windows 8 Shell Application
===========================

This Simple Windows 8 Store Application is the basis for many of my test apps.

It includes the following Javascript libraries:

 - [jQuery 1.7.2](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/03/21/jquery-1-7-2-released/)
 - [jQueryUI 1.8.17](http://ui-dev.jquery.com/download)
 - [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
 - [Require](http://requirejs.org/)
 - [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
 
 
This simple application contains the basis for a Header and footer, as well as  
a main content section with 1 simple SubView. It might seem odd that I am using  
Backbone for a Windows 8 store application, but the short answer is that I like  
it better this way than the native Pagination functionality.

**This Application will not be validated by the Windows App Store** It contains  
jQuery DOM manipulation which currently fails App Store validation.
